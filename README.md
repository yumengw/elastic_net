# elastic_net
* Scripts to train a specific pathway network based on DNA mutation, somatic copy number variation, DNA methylation and gene expression profiles. 
* The scripts can be used to derive cancer-type specific or cohort-specific regulatory network. 
* More molecular profiles can be easily added into the model, such as protein expression and miRNA expression data.

# Usage
* Rscript elastic_net_regression.R

# Dependencies
* R (>= 3.1.0)
* R package [glmnet] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html)
